What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
> I realized that making the HTML file is the easiest part in web development because you just put all the content needed
> in the web. On the other hand, CSS is very confusing to use for a beginner because of many available features you can use.
> The layout and editing the design was the most time-consuming in this exercise as I struggle to layout properly my content.
